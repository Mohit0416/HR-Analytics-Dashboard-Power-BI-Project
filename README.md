âœ¨ HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project âœ¨

I recently created an HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze and visualize key employee data effectively.
This dashboard provides deep insights into workforce trends, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions.

ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:
:- Total Headcount, Attrition, and Attrition % to track workforce stability
:- Average Salary and Age KPIs for better workforce demographics understanding
:- Insights on Headcount by Department, Age Bucket, and Gender
:- Yearly Attrition & Headcount trends to identify long-term patterns
:- Recruitment Source Analysis to evaluate which platforms drive the most hires
ðŸ’¡ This dashboard helps organizations monitor employee trends, improve retention strategies, and optimize hiring efforts â€” all in one place!
